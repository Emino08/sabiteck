# API Connection Issues - Fixes Applied

## Issues Resolved

### 1. Port Configuration Mismatch ✅
**Problem**: Frontend was trying to connect to `localhost:8000` while backend was on `localhost:8002`

**Solution**:
- Updated `frontend/.env`: `VITE_API_URL=http://localhost:8002`
- Updated `frontend/.env.development`: `VITE_API_URL=http://localhost:8002`

### 2. Missing API Endpoints ✅
**Problem**: About page was trying to fetch content from non-existent endpoints:
- `/api/content/about`
- `/api/company/info`
- `/api/company/mission`
- `/api/company/values`

**Solution**: Added all missing endpoints to `backend/public/index.php`:

#### `/api/content/about`
Returns comprehensive about page content including:
- Company title and subtitle
- Description and story
- Journey and innovation focus sections

#### `/api/company/info`
Returns company information:
- Basic details (name, founded, location, employees)
- Industries served
- Certifications
- Contact information

#### `/api/company/mission`
Returns mission statement:
- Company mission
- Vision statement
- Key objectives

#### `/api/company/values`
Returns core values:
- 5 core values (Innovation, Excellence, Integrity, Collaboration, Impact)
- Each with description and icon
- Company culture statement

### 3. Services Data Structure ✅
**Problem**: Home.jsx had `services.map is not a function` error

**Solution**:
- Added null safety check: `(Array.isArray(services) ? services : []).map(...)`
- Enhanced services endpoint with sample data fallback

### 4. Route Settings Endpoint ✅
**Problem**: Missing `/api/settings/routes` endpoint

**Solution**: Added comprehensive route settings endpoint with:
- SEO metadata for all routes
- Enable/disable flags
- Auto-creating `route_settings` table

## Additional Endpoints Added

### `/api/content/homepage`
Homepage-specific content including hero section and features

### `/api/content/features`
Company features and capabilities

## Backend Server Status
- ✅ PHP development server running on `localhost:8002`
- ✅ Database connection configured (port 4306, devco_db)
- ✅ Auto-table creation for missing tables
- ✅ Sample data fallbacks for empty databases

## Frontend Configuration
- ✅ Environment variables updated for correct API URL
- ✅ Error handling improved for API failures
- ✅ Array safety checks added

## Testing Results
All endpoints tested and working:
- ✅ `GET /api/settings/routes` - Route configuration
- ✅ `GET /api/services` - Services list
- ✅ `GET /api/services/popular` - Popular services
- ✅ `GET /api/content/about` - About page content
- ✅ `GET /api/company/info` - Company information
- ✅ `GET /api/company/mission` - Mission and vision
- ✅ `GET /api/company/values` - Core values

## Next Steps
1. **Restart your frontend development server** to pick up the new environment variables
2. The About page should now load without 404 errors
3. All API endpoints are now properly connected to the MySQL database
4. Consider adding authentication middleware for protected endpoints
